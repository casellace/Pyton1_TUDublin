""" 2.Merge the Dublin local authorities into one and store in a new shapefile.
    Don't forget to store the attributes as well as the geometry.
	3.	Calculate the centroid for Dublin merged and store this in a new shapefile.
	4.	Geocode the address of this centroid.
	You will need to convert the CRS to WGS84. This should be stored in the shapefile you created in the last step.â€¨
